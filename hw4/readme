The main difference between expand_fsm1 and expand_fsm2 is that the first is an fsa (no output) and the second
is a transducer, in which each character outputs itself, and then when each expanded morphotactic path is complete
there is an arc with empty input (*e*) that outputs the string with the completed morphotactic rule name.

e.g "sings" will have input output pairs that look like this:

s:s i:i n:n g:g *e*:irreg_verb_stem s:s *e*:3sing

For both of them I chose to make a separate path for each word (to prevent naming collisions) with the idea of minimising later.
This is less efficient than combining paths (which would work for the example given) but prevent invisible logic bugs
in other possible situations. And the redundancy would go away if we minimised later anyway.
