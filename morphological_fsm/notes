Given the rule: `(q0 (q2 irreg_verb_stem))` and lexicon entry `sing irreg_verb_stem`,
is the proper expansion something like this

(q0 (q0s s))
(q0s (q0si i))
(q0si (q0sin n))
(q0sin (q2 g))


One mistake I made implementing this was that i was not populating the epsilon transitions from the morph_rules
file into expanded fsa, because they did not exist in the lexicon file.
It meant that I was not accepting the `irreg_verb_stem`s.  In case it happens to someone else....
