Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
`` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .
Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .
`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .
